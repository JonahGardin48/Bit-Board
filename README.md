# Bit-Board

Starting off with the utility class, I had the base foundations of what a class like this needed to do, I just needed to implement it in a way that it could perform actions with bits instead of normal data types. I scoured the project details sheet for all the items this class might need, which I combined to make the class itself. I have always programmed in java, so I knew I wanted to do that after I found out that java did bitwise functions. I also learned about the << function when researching some of those functions. I found that I needed my converter method to be used on almost every other method to make sure the output was correct. 

My variables were quite simple here, as the methods only need a value and position, and the arithmetic needed two values. To output all the correct binary strings, I made sure all of the methods used the string return.
